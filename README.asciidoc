productelevision
----------------

productelevision periodically takes screenshots until it is sent a
keyboard interrupt signal, at which point it merges the screenshots
together into a video. The video is used to monitor the productivity of
the individual and determine if they are suitable for use in the
workplace or at home. It can then be used at a later date for the
purposes of entertainment.

I use +scrot+ for screenshots and +avconv+ (formerly +ffmpeg+) to
combine them into movies; at this point in time, you have to, too. And I
delete the image files after the movie is complete, so you don't get to
keep them either. But at 50 lines, anyone has the power to change the
script to fulfill their wildest dreams.
